Some of the same graphs made with the R programming language in the 'RscriptsForGraphs' repository but with Python, displayed on a Jupyter notebook.

The graphs were made for the purpose of data analysis for my master's thesis in geochemistry, therefore  mainly organic matter, isotopes and another geochemical elements were used as parameters. Replace it with the parameters you need!

*These repositories are mainly  for me to save the scripts somewhere, but with the intention to organize it later so anyone can use it!
